# ansible-functional-test-example


The most part of this code was taken from 

https://github.com/Matt-B/cucumber-js-selenium-webdriver-example

to have a simple working version of a cucumber js test.

A simple express app will be used insead of google.

And ansible will provision a windows server for the testing with chrome and deploy the application.
